    Smith was raised in a Baptist household and attended a Roman Catholic school and church. In a 2013 interview, he
    said he did not identify as religious.[102] In 2015, Smith said in an interview with The Christian Post that his
    Christian faith, which was instilled in him by his grandmother, helped him to accurately portray Bennet Omalu in
    Concussion, saying, "She was my spiritual teacher, she was that grandmother at the church, the one having the kids
    doing the Easter presentations and putting on the Christmas plays and her kids and grandkids had to be first. She
    was the most spiritually certain person that I had ever met in my entire life. Even to the point that when she was
    dying she was happy, like she was really excited about going to heaven."</p>
<p>
    In 2018, Smith performed the Hindu rite of Abhisheka of Lord Shiva at Haridwar, India. He also performed an Aarti of
    the holy river Ganga. He has said that he feels a deep connection to Hindu spirituality and Indian astrology

    to three Scientology organizations; the remaining beneficiaries included "a Los Angeles mosque, other
    Christian-based schools and churches, and ... the Yitzhak Rabin Memorial Center in Israel."[105] Smith and his wife
    have also founded a private elementary school in Calabasas, California, the New Village Leadership Academy.[106]

    his wife hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway to celebrate Obama's winning of the prize.

    In 2012, Smith stated he supported legalizing same-sex marriage.

    In 2021, Smith announced that production of his upcoming film, Emancipation, is being pulled from Georgia because of
    the recent passage of the Election Integrity Act of 2021, which critics view as a restrictive voting law. Smith and
    director Antoine Fuqua released a joint statement: "We cannot in good conscience provide economic support to a
    government that enacts regressive voting laws that are designed to restrict voter access".</p>

<h3 class="subtitle">Views on marriage and relationships</h3>
<p>
    Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith have expressed unconventional views on their monogamy, jokingly calling their
    commitment "bad marriage for life".[113] Both he and Pinkett Smith have admitted to having extramarital
    relationships and believing in the freedom to pursue them. Smith said he wanted a polyamorous relationship with
    actress Halle Berry and ballerina Misty Copeland but through therapy ultimately abandoned the idea.
